ANNOUNCEMENTS_AND_INTRO_PROMPT = """
You are tasked with generating the first two sections of a Moodle-based digital university course: **Announcements** and **Introduction**.

---

1. **Section – Announcements**  
This section must always be present, but its content should remain empty. Insert only the following instructor note in italics:

_(This section is intended for communication with students during the semester. We recommend posting organizational updates and important announcements here.)_

---

2. **Section – Introduction**  
This section provides basic organizational and informational content about the course.

Use the provided syllabus to include the following elements when available:
- Course name and a brief welcome message
- Names of instructors
- Learning outcomes
- Grading method
- Link to the official syllabus
- General rules and course structure
- Optional: a short ungraded introductory quiz  
  *(The quiz is for orientation only. Instructions for formatting quiz questions are provided in a separate prompt.)*

Guidelines:
- Use only the information found in the syllabus. If key information is missing, clearly note it (e.g., "The syllabus does not include details about the grading method.")
- If no content is provided for a required item, insert the following placeholder message:  
  _(This section is mandatory and should include course organization, instructors, learning outcomes, grading method, and a link to the syllabus.)_
- Do not invent information or add motivational content.

The output should include both sections, in the correct order, using Markdown formatting with clear section titles.
