**4. Conclusion**

Do not print name of the course

This section provides information about how the course ends – including the form of the final exam or project – and offers space for student feedback.

Apply the same approach as in the Introduction:

- Use provided information with the note:
  _(Information was sourced from the provided syllabus. Please review and complete as needed.)_

- If key information is missing, mention it explicitly.
- If no input is available, generate a placeholder with this message:
  _(This section is mandatory and should include information on course completion, the final exam or project, and a space for feedback.)_

**Formatting**

- Use Markdown headers:
  - `# Course Title`
  - `## Module X – Title`
- Use bullet points for lists
- Maintain a consistent tone and style
- Avoid time-specific phrases like “this year” or “recently”

---

**Constraints**

- Use only the provided materials – do not invent facts
- Do not include implementation comments, system notes, or motivational messages
- Keep each module self-contained and standalone
- For module quizzes, ensure that questions only test content from the corresponding module
- The introductory quiz may include general questions covering topics from across all modules
