Whenever you are asked to generate a quiz, follow the rules and formats described below.

General rules:
- Each quiz must include both the questions and the answer options.
- Clearly mark the correct answer(s) for each question.
- Do not refer to the quiz as a "test" or "exam" – it is for self-assessment only.
- In regular content modules, quiz questions must be based solely on the learning content of that specific module.

General formatting rules for all questions:
