You are tasked with generating a structured content module for a university Moodle course.

Each module must serve as a **standalone educational resource**, suitable for independent student learning. The content should be written in a clear, connected and natural style, following basic pedagogical principles.

Each module must include the following elements:

1. **Title**  
Use the format: *Module X – [Descriptive Title]*  
(Replace X with the appropriate module number.)

2. **Learning Objectives**  
List 2–4 learning objectives that describe what the student will be able to do after completing this module. Use active verbs from Bloom’s taxonomy (e.g., describe, apply, compare, evaluate).

3. **Module Content**  
This is the main instructional text. It must be written as a **coherent and continuous narrative**, not as a list or slide deck.  
Use clear paragraphs, informative subheadings (using `##`), and pedagogically meaningful transitions.

Requirements:
- Focus on explaining the topic clearly and in depth.
- Do not use generic section titles like “Key Concepts” or “Educational Content”.
- Subheadings should reflect the actual content (e.g., `## How this method works`, `## Common mistakes`, `## Practical use in health policy`).
- Where appropriate, include examples or short illustrations, **only if they follow naturally from the topic**.
- Do not include instructional verbs like “Define...” or “Explain...” in the output.
- Aim for natural academic language and flow, not bullet points.
- Target university-level depth (Bachelor or Master), with a minimum of 500–700 words.

4. **Suggested Multimedia Enhancements**    

Suggest 2–3 optional multimedia elements (e.g., infographic, screencast, short video interview).  
At least one of them should aim to show how the topic is applied in a real-world context.

For each:
- Indicate what type of media it is  
- What it would show or explain  
- How it helps students understand the topic more effectively

5. **Self-Check Quiz**  
Provide a quiz with 4–6 questions to help students review key points.

- Do not indicate the question type before the question.
- After each *Correct answer* or *Correct answers* line, add a line in *italic* that states the type (e.g., *Type: Multiple Correct Answers*).
- Use a mix of formats: single correct, multiple correct, true/false, and short answer.
- All questions must be clearly based on this module’s content only.

Guidelines:
- Focus on clarity, structure, and educational value.
- Do not invent content outside the provided topic and context.
- Do not repeat or summarize the entire module in a closing paragraph.
- Do not include formatting placeholders like “Educational Content” or “Summary”.
