This task is part of an educational content development process for university-level e-learning.  
The output will be used as official course material in a Moodle-based learning management system.  
Please treat this as instructional content creation – not as a request for academic help or assignment solving.

Each content module represents one of the main instructional units of the course. It should contain the full educational content needed for students to understand the topic thoroughly, with enough detail for independent study and preparation for assignments or exams. The output must be suitable as a standalone learning resource published in the LMS.

Each module must include the following elements:

1. **Title**  
Use the format: *Module X – [Descriptive Title]*  
(Replace X with the appropriate module number.)

2. **Learning Objectives**  
List 3–5 concise bullet points describing what the student should be able to do or understand after completing the module. Focus on active skills and knowledge aligned with Bloom's taxonomy (e.g., explain, apply, compare, analyze).

3. **Educational Content**  
Present a detailed and well-structured instructional text divided into logical sections using `##` level subheadings (e.g., `## Introduction`, `## Key Methods`, `## Examples and Use Cases`).  
Ensure each section is informative, step-by-step, and uses clear academic language.  
Define all key terms and include examples or analogies. Where appropriate, include references to real-world applications.  
Avoid excessive technical jargon, but do not oversimplify. The content should be long and detailed enough to cover the topic thoroughly. As a general guideline, aim for the equivalent of 800–1200 words, but adjust as needed based on the complexity and available input materials.


4. **Suggested Multimedia Enhancements**  
Recommend 2–3 types of multimedia or interactive elements (e.g., screencast, infographic, diagram, simulation, podcast, video, animation) that would be suitable to complement this module. Do not include or mention any specific external resources or links. Instead, suggest what type of media could be added and explain why it would be pedagogically useful. Be specific: if you propose a diagram, indicate the type (e.g., architecture diagram, flowchart, concept map) and what it would help illustrate. If you suggest a video or podcast, describe its potential topic and the value it would bring to learners.

5. **Summary**  
Include a short paragraph (4–6 sentences) summarizing the most important concepts and insights from the module.

6. **Self-Check Quiz**  
Create a quiz with **5 to 6 questions** based only on this module’s content.  
Use a mix of question types (single correct answer, multiple correct answers, true/false) as defined in the quiz format prompt.  
Clearly mark correct answer(s) and indicate the question type as instructed.

Do not refer to the quiz as a “test”.  
Do not use citations, references, placeholders, or motivational commentary.

Use only the information provided in the input materials or syllabus. Do not invent facts or content.
