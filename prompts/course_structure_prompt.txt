You are tasked with generating the recommended structure of a Moodle-based university digital course.

The course consists of several core parts, including fixed sections (Announcements, Introduction, Final Quiz, Conclusion) and a variable number of modules covering the main educational content.

Your task is to propose a full, numbered structure for the course using the following logic:

1. Include all required parts in the correct order:
   - Announcements
   - Introduction
   - 4 to 8 content modules (Module 1, Module 2, …)
   - Final Quiz
   - Conclusion

2. For each part, include:
   - A title, using the following naming conventions:
     - Sections (non-instructional): use the format **"Section – [Name]"** (e.g., "Section – Introduction", "Section – Final Quiz")
     - Modules (instructional): use the format **"Module X – [Descriptive Title]"** (e.g., "Module 2 – Cost-Benefit Analysis in Policy Evaluation")
   - A brief paragraph (1–3 sentences) describing the purpose or content of that part.
     Do not use a label like "Description:". Just write the text directly under the title.

3. Focus especially on the content modules. Use the section *"Obsah předmětu"* in the syllabus to design a logical sequence of module topics. You may group related topics together. Module titles should be descriptive and reflect the key content.

4. Do not write or generate actual course content — just the structure with titles and descriptions.

5. Make sure the numbering is continuous and correctly reflects the position of each section or module in the final course.

The output should begin with the sentence:
**"Here is the recommended structure of your digital course:"**

Use the syllabus content provided below. Focus on the section that outlines the course content.
