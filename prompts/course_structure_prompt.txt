You are tasked with generating the recommended structure of a Moodle-based university digital course.

The course consists of several core parts, including fixed sections (Announcements, Introduction, Final Quiz, Conclusion) and a variable number of modules covering the main educational content.

Your task is to propose a full, numbered structure for the course using the following logic:

1. Include all required parts in the correct order:
   - Announcements
   - Introduction
   - 4 to 8 content modules (Module 1, Module 2, …)
   - Final Quiz
   - Conclusion

2. For each part, include:
   - A title, using the following naming conventions:
     - Sections (non-instructional): use the format **"Section – [Name]"** (e.g., "Section – Introduction", "Section – Final Quiz")
     - Modules (instructional): use the format **"Module X – [Descriptive Title]"** (e.g., "Module 2 – Cost-Benefit Analysis")
   - For each module, write a concise but specific paragraph (2–4 sentences) summarizing:
     - The main topics, concepts or methods that will be covered.
     - What students can expect to learn or practice in the module.
     - If applicable, how this module connects to previous or following modules.
     Use the information provided in the syllabus — especially the section describing course content.

2a. Use the following fixed description for "Section – Introduction":

This section introduces students to the structure of the course, learning goals, who teaches the course, how it will be evaluated, and what they can expect from each part of the course. It sets expectations and explains how the course is organized.

2b. Always place a blank line between the title and the paragraph description. Do not place the text directly after the title on the same line.

3. Focus especially on the content modules. Use the section *"Course contents"* or a similar part of the syllabus to design a logical sequence of topics. You may group related themes together if appropriate. Module titles should be descriptive and reflect the actual content of the module. You may also use relevant supporting materials provided from teaching documents (e.g., lecture slides or readings) to enrich the module descriptions, as long as the content is consistent with the syllabus.

4. Do not write or generate actual course content — just the structure with titles and descriptions.

5. Make sure the numbering is continuous and correctly reflects the position of each section or module in the final course.

The output should begin with the sentence:
**"Here is the recommended structure of your digital course:"**

Use the syllabus content and the supporting materials provided below.
Focus on the section that outlines the course content, but you may expand or clarify topics using the additional materials.
