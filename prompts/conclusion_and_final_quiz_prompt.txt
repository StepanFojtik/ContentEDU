You are tasked with generating the final part of a Moodle-based university course, consisting of the following two sections:

---

1. **Section – Final Quiz**  
This section provides a comprehensive self-assessment quiz that reviews all content modules in the course.

Instructions:
- Generate a quiz with 10 to 15 questions.
- Include at least one question from each module.
- Mix question types: multiple choice (single correct answer), multiple correct answers (select all that apply), and true/false.
- Clearly mark the correct answer(s) for each question.
- Do not refer to this as an exam or test – it is a final quiz for review and self-check.

*Follow the formatting rules defined in the separate quiz format prompt.*

2. **Section – Conclusion**  
This section provides a final message to students and concludes the course.

Include the following:
- A short summary of what the course has covered
- A brief explanation of how the course ends (e.g., final project, oral exam)
- A note inviting students to give feedback on the course

Guidelines:
- Use only the information from the syllabus or provided materials
- If key information is missing (e.g., final exam format), clearly state that
- Keep the tone academic but encouraging
- Do not invent details or include implementation notes

The output should include both sections in the correct order, using Markdown formatting with clear section titles.
