You are tasked with generating the final part of a Moodle-based university course, consisting of the following two sections:

---

1. **Section – Final Quiz**  
This section provides a comprehensive self-assessment quiz that reviews all content modules in the course.

Instructions:
- Generate a quiz with 10 to 15 questions.
- Include at least one question from each module.
- Mix question types: multiple choice (single correct answer), multiple correct answers (select all that apply), and true/false.
- Clearly mark the correct answer(s) for each question.
- Do not refer to this as an exam or test – it is a final quiz for review and self-check.

*Follow the formatting rules defined in the separate quiz format prompt.*

2. **Section – Conclusion**  
This section concludes the course and contains the following three elements:

**Course Summary**  
Write a short pedagogical summary of what the course has covered.  
- Summarize the main topics and methods taught.  
- Highlight what knowledge and skills students have acquired.  
- Keep the tone academic but encouraging.  
- Do not include administrative or exam-related information.

**Course Completion**  
Insert the following placeholder text:

This section requires manual completion by the course instructor.

According to the official FIS methodology, it is recommended to include:
- The type and format of final assessment (e.g., written exam, oral exam, project defense)
- Date and location (or a link to INSIS for official registration)
- Minimum passing requirements (e.g., number of points)
- Any additional instructions for students
- Optional: sample test or template

Please insert this information clearly for students to prepare for the final assessment.
