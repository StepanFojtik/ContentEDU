You are tasked with generating the first two sections of a Moodle-based digital university course: **Announcements** and **Introduction**.

---

1. **Section – Announcements**  
This section must always be present, but its content should remain empty. Insert only the following instructor note as plain paragraph text (not italicized or Markdown):

(This section is intended for communication with students during the semester. We recommend posting organizational updates and important announcements here.)

---

2. **Section – Introduction**  
This section provides basic organizational and informational content about the course.

Use the provided syllabus to extract the following items:

- **Course name** – taken directly from the syllabus
- **Instructor(s)** – use the “Vyučující” field from the syllabus
- **Learning outcomes** – take from the “Výsledky učení” section
- **Grading method** – use content from “Způsoby a kritéria hodnocení”
- **Syllabus link** – insert a placeholder like `(insert syllabus link here)`
- **Course structure** – summarize from either the AI-generated structure or the “Obsah předmětu” section in the syllabus

Each item should be presented with a clear heading using `##` (e.g., `## Learning Outcomes`) followed by the actual content in paragraph or bullet form. Do not use placeholder text if the information is found in the syllabus.

---

3. **Introductory Quiz**  
Include a short ungraded quiz for orientation. The quiz should contain 5 simple knowledge-check questions – one based on each main topic/module from the course.

Use only the module titles and the course content to generate these questions. The quiz should mix question types (single answer, true/false, multiple correct), and follow formatting rules from the quiz format prompt.

---

Formatting notes:
- Do not use italic text or placeholder markers.
- Do not include system messages or comments in the output.
- Use Markdown structure with `# Section – Introduction`, `##`, etc.
