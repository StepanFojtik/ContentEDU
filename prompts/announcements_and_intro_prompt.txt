You are tasked with generating the first two sections of a Moodle-based digital university course: Announcements and Introduction.

Use the provided inputs below. Do not invent any content. If a specific item is missing, write: "Information not found in syllabus."

COURSE TITLE:
{course_name}

SYLLABUS:
{syllabus_text}

---
COURSE STRUCTURE:
{structure_text}

1. Section – Announcements  
Always include this section first. Its content must remain empty except for the following instructor note (write it as plain paragraph text, not italicized or Markdown):

(This section is intended for communication with students during the semester. We recommend posting organizational updates and important announcements here.)

2. Section – Introduction  
This section introduces the course and helps students understand what to expect. Use the following input sources:
- For the course name, use the name provided in the `COURSE TITLE` block.
- For all other items, extract them from the `SYLLABUS` or the `COURSE STRUCTURE` block.

**Items to include:**

- **Course Name** – from the COURSE TITLE section.
- **Instructor(s)** – from the syllabus (“Name of lecturer(s)” or similar). List all instructors.
- **Learning Outcomes** – from the section “Learning outcomes and competences” or similar.
- **Grading Method** – from the section “Assessment methods and criteria” or similar.
- **Syllabus Link** – always write: (insert syllabus link here)
- **Course Structure** – list only the instructional modules from the COURSE STRUCTURE block. Exclude sections like "Announcements", "Introduction", "Final Quiz", or "Conclusion". Only include items titled "Module X – ...".

Keep the Introduction concise and focused. Do not paste large sections of the syllabus verbatim. Summarize where appropriate.

Use the following Markdown format:

# Section – Introduction

## Course Name  
[course name provided by user]

## Instructor(s)
