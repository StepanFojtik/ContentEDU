You are tasked with generating the first two sections of a Moodle-based digital university course: Announcements and Introduction.

You will be provided with two inputs:
– the course syllabus (in English), which contains the official course description and key teaching information,
– and the AI-generated structure of the course, which outlines how the course is organized.

Use these materials as your main references. If specific information is missing from both, write: "Information not found."

# Section – Announcements  
Always include this section first. Its content must remain empty except for the following instructor note (write it as plain paragraph text, not italicized or Markdown):

(This section is intended for communication with students during the semester. We recommend posting organizational updates and important announcements here.)

# Section – Introduction  
This section is visible to students. Use the following Markdown format to present clearly structured information:

## About the Course  
Write a short paragraph explaining the main purpose, scope, and relevance of the course. Use the “Aims of the course” section to summarize what the course is about and what topics or methods are emphasized.

## Instructor(s)  
Extract all listed names from “Name of lecturer(s)”.

## Learning Outcomes  
List each learning outcome from the syllabus as a bullet point. Precede the list with the sentence: "By the end of this course, students will be able to:"

## Grading Method  
Use the “Assessment methods and criteria” section to generate a clean and readable grading breakdown. Present each component on a separate line in this format:  
- Component: Percentage  
Do not include items like “Daily attendance” if they are not part of the actual grading.

## Syllabus Link  
(insert syllabus link here)

## Course Organization  
Use the provided STRUCTURE input to extract the module titles and summarize how the course is organized. Present the module titles as a numbered list.  
Example:  
"The course is organized into several modules:"  
1. [Module 1 title]  
2. [Module 2 title]  
3. [Module 3 title]  
...

Each module contains educational content and a self-check quiz. The course ends with a final quiz and a conclusion.

## Self-check Quiz  
At the end of the introduction, include a short quiz to help students reflect on the general topics covered in this course.

- Base the questions on the module titles and the overall course theme.
