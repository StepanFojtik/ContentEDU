**Quiz Format Requirements**

Each quiz, whether part of the introduction or included at the end of a module, must follow these rules:

- Always include **both the questions and the answer options**.
- Clearly mark the correct answer(s) for each question.
- Questions can be of the following three types:

1. **Single Correct Answer (Standard Multiple Choice):**
   - Provide one question with **four answer options**.
   - Only **one option is correct**.
   - Indicate the correct answer, for example:  
     - *Correct answer: B*

2. **True/False:**
   - Provide a statement and specify whether it is *True* or *False*.
   - Example format:  
     - Statement: "Data normalization reduces redundancy."  
     - Answer: *True*

3. **Multiple Correct Answers (Multiple Choice – Multiple Answers):**
   - Provide one question with **multiple answer options** (typically 4–6).
   - More than one option may be correct.
   - **Explicitly indicate** which options are correct, for example:  
     - *Correct answers: A, C*

- Always specify when a question is a **multiple-answer type** (e.g., "Select all that apply").
"""
**Formatting**

- Use Markdown headers:
  - `# Course Title`
  - `## Module X – Title`
- Use bullet points for lists
- Maintain a consistent tone and style
- Avoid time-specific phrases like “this year” or “recently”

**Constraints**

- Use only the provided materials – do not invent facts
- Do not include implementation comments, system notes, or motivational messages
- Keep each module self-contained and standalone
- For module quizzes, ensure that questions only test content from the corresponding module
- The introductory quiz may include general questions covering topics from across all modules
