CONTENT_MODULE_PROMPT = """
You are tasked with generating a structured content module for a Moodle-based university course.

Each content module represents one of the main instructional units of the course. It should contain the full educational content that helps students understand the topic and prepare for exams or assignments. The output must be suitable as a standalone learning resource.

Each module must include the following elements:

1. **Title**  
Use the format: *Module X – [Descriptive Title]*  
(Replace X with the appropriate module number.)

2. **Learning Objectives**  
List 2–4 concise bullet points describing what the student should be able to do or understand after completing the module.

3. **Educational Content**  
This is the core of the module. Write a clear, pedagogically structured explanation of the topic.  
Structure the content into sections using subheadings. Explain concepts step by step, define key terms, and use examples or analogies where appropriate.  
This content should be complete enough for a student to study the topic independently and understand it well enough to succeed in course assessments.  
Avoid excessive technical jargon, but do not oversimplify.

4. **Summary**  
Include a short paragraph summarizing the key points of the module.

5. **Self-Check Quiz**  
Create a short quiz (4–6 questions) that allows students to reflect on and review the material.  
This quiz is for self-assessment only – do not refer to it as a “test”.  
*Follow the formatting rules defined in the separate quiz format prompt.*

Guidelines:
- Use only the information provided in the syllabus or input materials.
- Do not include citations, references, system notes, or motivational commentary.
- The quiz questions must only refer to content from this specific module.
